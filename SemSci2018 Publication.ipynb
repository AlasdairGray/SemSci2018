    "__Abstract:__ In recent years there has been a reproducibility crisis in science. Computational notebooks, such as Jupyter, have been touted as one solution to this problem. However, when executing analyses over live SPARQL endpoints, we get different answers depending upon when the analysis in the notebook was executed. In this paper, we identify some of the issues discovered in trying to develop a reproducible analysis over a collection of biomedical data sources and suggest some best practice to overcome these issues.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years there has been a reproducibility crisis in science ([Baker; 2016](#Baker2016)). Open science advocates to overcome this crisis by openly publishing your work, included data, methods, and analysis ([Pearce; 2012](#Pearce2012)). Computational notebooks such as Jupyter ([Kluyver et al; 2016](#Kluyver2016)) that combine analysis with narrative are one approach to publishing scientific analysis methods. The approach is known as Literate Programming ([Knuth; 1984](#Knuth1984)). A key idea of Literate Programming is that the documentation of the analysis code is kept up to date with the code, as they are edited in the same environment. When writing the analysis, the author is forced to think about how others can understand and interpret the analysis, thus writing analysis in a way to aid understanding of the code ([Piccolo, Frampton; 2016](#Piccolo2016)). Ideally, the computation notebook becomes the publication, as this notebook attempts. Specifically, in this notebook we investigate the feasibility of publishing a reusable data analysis paper as a Jupyter Notebook in the Semanatic Web community. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is existing work on publishing computational workflows via notebooks ([Kluyver et al; 2016](#Kluyver2016)), and works in several scientific disciplines that have also used Jupyter Notebooks, e.g. Astronomy ([Farr et al; 2017](#Farr2017), [Medvedev et al; 2016](#Medvedev2016)), Biology ([Gr√ºning et al; 2017](#Gruning2017)), and Oceanography ([Turner and Gill; 2018](#Turner2018)). In their paper Kluyver et al ([2016](#Kluyver2016)) recognise some of the limitations of academic publishing within a Jupyter notebook, particularly in the lack of support for citations. In this work, we are looking at performing an analysis over pharmacology Linked Data.  The contents of this notebook provide a good starting point for those who want to do an analysis of the content of the chemical substances known in some of the leading chemisty databases used to support early stage pharmacology research, and supports the understanding of the evolution of their content. The analysis will compare the compound count between ChEBI ([Hastings et al; 2016](#Hastings2016)), ChEMBL ([Gaulton et al; 2017](#Gaulton2017)), DrugBank ([Wishart et al; 2018](#Wishart2018)), and Guide to Pharmacology ([Harding et al; 2018](#Harding2018)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we will first setup our computational environment in [Section 2](#Method). We will then perform a simple, but crucial, analysis in [Section 3](#Analysis) that does a crude comparison over four major pharmacology datasets.  We will then discuss and conclude the paper in [Section 4](#Conclusions)."

    "The ChEMBL and Guide to Pharmacology datasets contain more data in the SPARQL endpoint than the PubChem version. This is to be expected as the datasets available through the SPARQL endpoints are newer and the datasets are adding more content. The Guide to Pharmacology change between June and July corresponds with the release of version [2018.3](https://blog.guidetopharmacology.org/2018/06/28/database-release-2018-3/) on 28 June 2018. The exception to this is DrugBank, which has seen a decrease. This is due to the Bio2RDF endpoint offering an older version of the dataset.\n",

    "On PubChem we were able to calculate the intersection of the datasets, i.e. we could count the number of substances that are contained in all the datasets. This has not been possible with the SPARQL endpoints due to the distributed nature of the endpoints and the unreliability of federated queries. There are also complications due to the way that the substance structures (InChI Keys) are represented in the various datasets. The following queries demonstrate the output of the first 5 results of each dataset."

    "## 4. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have conducted a very simple analysis, counting the number of compounds in different pharmacology datasets. The purpose of publishing this as a notebook (c.f. open science) is to enable the repetition of this computation, since the datasets are continuously evolving, and to share our methods in a way that allows others to reproduce our results whilst also reading our narrative. However, this has raised the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How should you present the computational environment used?\n",
    "1. How should you present the results of the original computation against those of the live results when the content of datasets is evolving?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first question, you would ideally use the computational environment to report about itself. However, this is not always straightforward. Libraries don't necessarily report their versions, and SPARQL endpoints all have different approaches (or perhaps none) for providing metadata about their datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question focuses on recognising that sources change over time, often gaining more data, although as shown with the ChEBI data sometimes containing errors too. The publication of this notebook captures a point in time, or indeed three. The first is the time when the query was run over the PubChem database (15 March 2018), the second when the SAPRQL queries were executed for the peer review version of this notebook (8 June 2018), and the third when the camera ready version was prepared (24 July 2018). This allowed us to compare the results at the different timepoints. In this notebook we chose to copy the results of the computation for publication into the text in order to allow others reusing the notebook to be able to compare their answers. We hope that this proves to be a useful approach. We note that the reuse of this notebook relies on the continued availability of the SPARQL endpoints. Newer computational notebook environments are being developed that overcome some of the limitations of Jupyter, e.g. Wrattler ([Petricek et al; 2018](#Petricek2018)), although these still need to mature and gain wider uptake by the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have deliberately not used any Jupyter extensions in this notebook, believing that this will aid reproducibility into the future. However, this complicated the generating of the paper in this notebook, as there is no inbuilt support for academic references. If the use of computational notebooks is to grow, then referencing needs to become a core feature. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate the additional effort required in making the notebook itself a semantic resource. There have already been several discussions on embedding metadata in Jupyter Notebooks. However, there is no UI support for entering this metadata, no standard approach for representing authorship metadata, and no support for creating this as semantic annotations.\n",
