    "__Abstract:__ In recent years there has been a reproducibility crisis in science. Computational notebooks, such as Jupyter, have been touted as a solution to this problem. However, when executing analyses over live SPARQL endpoints, we get different answers depending upon when the analysis in the notebook was executed. In this paper, we identify some of the issues discovered in trying to develop a reproducible analysis over a collection of biomedical data sources and suggest some best practice to overcome these issues.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years there has been a reproducibility crisis in science ([Baker; 2016](#Baker2016)). Computational notebooks such as Jupyter ([Kluyver et al; 2016](#Kluyver2016)) that combine analysis with narrative have been touted as a solution to this problem. The approach is known as Literate Programming ([Knuth; 1984](#Knuth1984)). A key idea of Literate Programming is that the documentation of the analysis code is kept up to date with the code, as they are edited in the same environment. When writing the analysis, the author is forced to think about how others can understand and interpret the analysis, thus writing analysis in a way to aid understanding of the code ([Piccolo, Frampton; 2016](#Piccolo2016)). Ideally, the computation notebook becomes the publication, as this notebook attempts. Specifically, in this notebook we investigate the feasibility of publishing a reusable data analysis paper as a Jupyter Notebook in the Semanatic Web community. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is existing work on publishing computational workflows via notebooks ([Kluyver et al; 2016](#Kluyver2016)). Indeed, in their paper Kluyver et al recognise some of the limitations of academic publishing within a Jupyter notebook, particularly in the lack of support for citations. In this work, we are looking at performing an analysis over pharmacology Linked Data.  The contents of this notebook provide a good starting point for those who want to do an analysis of the content of the chemical substances known in some of the leading chemisty databases used to support early stage pharmacology research, and supports the understanding of the evolution of their content. The analysis will compare the compound count between ChEBI ([Hastings et al; 2016](#Hastings2016)), ChEMBL ([Gaulton et al; 2017](#Gaulton2017)), DrugBank ([Wishart et al; 2018](#Wishart2018)), and Guide to Pharmacology ([Harding et al; 2018](#Harding2018)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we will first setup our computational environment in [Section 2](#Method). We will then perform a simple, but crucial, analysis in [Section 3](#Analysis) that does a crude comparison over four major pharmacology datasets.  We will then discuss and conclude the paper in [Section 4](#Conclusions)."

    "## 4. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have conducted a very simple analysis, counting the number of compounds in different pharmacology datasets. However, it has raised several questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How should you present the computational environment used?\n",
    "1. How should you present the results of the original computation against those of the live results when the content of datasets is evolving?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first question, you would ideally use the computational environment to report about itself. However, this is not always straightforward. Libraries don't necessarily report their versions, and SPARQL endpoints all have different approaches (or perhaps none) for providing metadata about their datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question focuses on recognising that sources change over time, often gaining more date. The publication of this notebook captures a point in time, or indeed two. The first is the time when the query was run over the PubChem database and the second when the SAPRQL queries were executed. This allowed us to compare the results. In this notebook we chose to copy the results of the computation for publication into the text in order to allow others reusing the notebook to be able to compare their answers. We hope that this proves to be a useful approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have deliberately not used any Jupyter extensions in this notebook, believing that this will aid reproducibility into the future. However, this complicated the generating of the paper in this notebook, as there is no inbuilt support for academic references. If the use of computational notebooks is to grow, then referencing needs to become a core feature. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate the additional effort required in making the notebook itself a semantic resource."
